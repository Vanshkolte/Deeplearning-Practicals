## ðŸ“˜ Introduction  
Deep Learning Practicals cover the implementation and experimentation with neural networks, focusing on concepts such as:  
- Perceptron and Deep Neural Networks (DNN)  
- Optimizers:  
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)  
  - Momentum-Based Gradient Descent  
  - Nesterov Accelerated Gradient Descent  
- Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, loss, and confusion matrices.
